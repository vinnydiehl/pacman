# repl.rb allows you to test complex code in your game console, from your text
# editor. Place something like this in repl.rb:
#
# repl do
#   puts "Hello world!"
# end
#
# Save the file and it will run whatever code is in that block in the running
# game's console. Replace `repl` with `xrepl` to disable that block of code.
#
# This file will not be checked in as it is meant for debugging random things
# during development and will be constantly changing with irrelevant code.
